      I was born in California on October 21! I love cake and tea-best combination ever- so much I eat both everyday! My favourite colour is pastel tones (loved them even more since pastel is spanish for cake)! I go to The King’s Academy and going into junior year! My favourite subject at school is biology and calculus! My special talent is that I am pretty flexible, and can make the best cup of earl grey! :D My hobbies are drawing, reading, and baking! I speak 3 languages, so at home it is a mixture of a lot!

      Likes:Besides cake, I love octopus! They are super cute and taste really good! My favourite savory food is tacos al pastor and jjamppong! My favourite book is Alice in Wonderland! One of my favourite movies is Pirates of the Caribbeans.
      Dislikes: I do not like cheese, hate the taste… I also dislike things that are not neat!
